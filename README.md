# Calculator
This repo is the source code of a simple calculator built using react (and [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)) when I tried to learn react. You can find the live demo [here](https://dannysiu392005.github.io/react-calculator-demo/).
